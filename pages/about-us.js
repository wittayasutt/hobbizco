              Teachers TV was funded by the UK government from 2004 to 2011 and developed
              an innovative 21st-century system for raising standards of teaching and
              learning by sharing good practice through broadcast-quality video. Teachers
              TV produced over 3500 videos which have set the standard for professional
              development video around the world. It was a modern converged service, using
              television, broadband and emerging mobile platforms to reach and influence
              the schools workforce in England as well as teachers from around the world.
              Over six years, Teachers TV proved itself a cost-effective solution to
              improving educational outcomes on a national and international scale. The
              Teachers TV model has now been replicated in two other countries: in
